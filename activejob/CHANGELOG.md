*   OpenSSL constants are now used for Digest computations.

    *Dirkjan Bussink*

*   Add a Serializer for the Range class

    This should allow things like `MyJob.perform_later(range: 1..100)`

*   Communicate enqueue failures to callers of `perform_later`.

    `perform_later` can now optionally take a block which will execute after
    the adapter attempts to enqueue the job. The block will receive the job
    instance as an argument even if the enqueue was not successful.
    Additionally, `ActiveJob` adapters now have the ability to raise an
    `ActiveJob::EnqueueError` which will be caught and stored in the job
    instance so code attempting to enqueue jobs can inspect any raised
    `EnqueueError` using the block.

        MyJob.perform_later do |job|
          unless job.successfully_enqueued?
            if job.enqueue_error&.message == "Redis was unavailable"
              # invoke some code that will retry the job after a delay
            end
          end
        end

*   Don't log rescuable exceptions defined with `rescue_from`.

    *Hu Hailin*

*   Allow `rescue_from` to rescue all exceptions.
